    "Building a platform and business like DataBroker DAO requires real sellers and buyers of IoT sensor data. Over the past couple of months we have been hard at work integrating these parties into an alliance. A few months ago, we already announced the first two official members of this DataBroker DAO alliance, YUKTIX and SENTHUS. Today we are proud to announce DESIDEDATUM, IQUADRAT, SKYLARK and TECHNILOG have joined.",

    "\"We are happy to cross paths with SettleMint and to engage with blockchain technology over DataBroker DAO. The integration was smooth and successful due to technical excellence. In a next step on our roadmap we intend to include a DataBrokerDAO “sell my data” option into our portfolio, as we realise this is a new monetisation opportunity for both sensor owners, data consumers and vendors\", said mr. Rajeev Jha - CEO of Yuktix",
  "alliance_senthus":
