    "DataBroker DAO gibi bir platform ve işletmenin kurulması , gerçek IoT sensör verisi ve alıcıları gerektirir. Son bir kaç aydır bu kişileri birliğe sokmak için çok çalıştık. Bir kaç aç önce, DataBroker DAO birliğinin ilk iki resmi üyesi olan YUKTIX ve SENTHUS'u açıklamıştık. Bugün, DESIDEDATUM, IQUADRAT, SKYLARK ve TECHNILOG'un katılımını açıklamaktan gurur duyuyoruz.",
  "alliance_quote":
    "Yuktix CEO’su Rajeev Jha \"SettleMint ile yollarımızın kesişmesinde ve DataBroker DAO üzerinde blockchain teknolojisinde bir araya gelmekten mutluluk duyuyoruz. Entegrasyon, teknik harikalıktan dolayı sorunsuz ve başarılıydı. Yol haritamızdaki bir sonraki adımda, portföyümüze DataBroker DATO “verimi sat” seçeneğini eklemeyi düşünüyoruz. Bunun, hem sensör sahipleri, veri tüketicileri için hem de satıcılar için yeni bir parasallaştırma fırsatı olduğunun farkındayız.” demiştir",
